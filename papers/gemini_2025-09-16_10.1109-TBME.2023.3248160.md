  Accurate estimation of ground reaction forces (GRFs) is crucial for biomechanical analysis and various applications, including rehabilitation, sports training, and gait analysis. While force plates offer high accuracy, their lab-based nature limits real-world applications. Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) present a promising alternative for GRF estimation in free-living environments. However, GRF estimation using IMUs is challenging due to the complex and subject-specific relationship between IMU signals and GRFs. This paper proposes a novel personalized GRF estimation framework that leverages multi-source data fusion and deep learning. The framework incorporates data from IMUs and other wearable sensors (e.g., pressure insoles) to enhance GRF estimation accuracy. A deep neural network (DNN) architecture is designed to learn the intricate relationships between sensor data and GRFs. Furthermore, a personalization strategy based on transfer learning is employed to adapt the model to individual users with limited subject-specific data. The framework is evaluated on a dataset collected from multiple subjects performing various locomotion activities. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed personalized GRF estimation framework achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods.  Specifically, the personalized model significantly improves GRF estimation accuracy, particularly for subjects with limited training data. The framework offers a practical and accurate solution for GRF estimation using wearable sensors in real-world settings.

## Summary

This paper addresses the challenge of accurately estimating Ground Reaction Forces (GRFs) using wearable sensors, specifically IMUs, in real-world environments.  The core problem is that GRF estimation from IMU data is highly subject-specific. The authors propose a deep learning-based framework that incorporates **personalization via transfer learning** and **multi-source data fusion** (IMUs + potentially other sensors like pressure insoles).

**Key Contributions:**

*   **Personalized GRF Estimation:**  The paper directly tackles the subject-specific nature of GRF estimation by using a transfer learning approach. A pre-trained model (trained on data from multiple subjects) is fine-tuned using limited data from a new individual. This drastically reduces the amount of subject-specific data needed for accurate estimation.

*   **Multi-Source Data Fusion:**  The framework isn't limited to just IMU data. It can incorporate data from other wearable sensors like pressure insoles to improve estimation accuracy. This fusion of information provides a more comprehensive picture of the user's movement and forces.

*   **Deep Neural Network Architecture:**  The authors design a DNN to learn the complex relationships between the sensor data and GRFs.

*   **Evaluation & Results:**  The paper provides experimental results that demonstrate the superiority of their personalized approach compared to existing methods. The personalization strategy is shown to be especially effective for users with limited training data.

**Significance:**

This work is significant because it moves towards more practical and accurate GRF estimation in real-world scenarios.  The personalization aspect makes the system adaptable to individual users, overcoming a major hurdle in IMU-based GRF estimation. The inclusion of transfer learning is particularly important, as it addresses the common problem of limited subject-specific training data in biomechanics research and applications. It's a strong example of how deep learning and personalization can be applied to improve GRF estimation using wearable sensors.
