# Estimating Ground Reaction Forces from Inertial Sensors

**Date of Discovery:** September 16, 2025

## Summary

This paper presents a lightweight machine learning approach for estimating ground reaction forces (GRFs) from inertial measurement unit (IMU) data collected during steady-state running. The authors introduce SVD Embedding Regression (SER), a linear regression method using SVD embeddings of IMU and GRF data, and compare it to k-Nearest-Neighbors (KNN) and state-of-the-art LSTM models. The study demonstrates that SER and KNN can match or outperform LSTMs in accuracy, with significantly lower inference times and computational requirements, making them suitable for edge devices and real-time biomechanical analysis.

## Main Problem

Current GRF estimation methods using LSTMs are computationally expensive, require extensive training and hyperparameter tuning, and act as black-box models. These limitations hinder their deployment on edge devices and in clinical or sports settings where real-time feedback is needed. The paper addresses whether lightweight models can provide accurate GRF and biomechanical variable estimation from IMU data, and how personal data impacts estimation accuracy.

## Key Idea

The key innovation is the use of SVD Embedding Regression (SER), which leverages linear regression between SVD embeddings of IMU and GRF data. This approach, along with KNN regression, offers interpretable, fast, and accurate estimation. The study also explores the impact of sensor placement (sacrum and shanks) and the use of personal data for model training.

## Results

* SER and KNN methods achieve similar or better accuracy than LSTMs for GRF and biomechanical variable estimation.
* Personal data significantly reduces estimation errors, especially for biomechanical variables.
* Lightweight models enable real-time analysis on edge devices, with minimal latency and computational overhead.
* The findings have clinical relevance for injury risk assessment and sports performance monitoring.
