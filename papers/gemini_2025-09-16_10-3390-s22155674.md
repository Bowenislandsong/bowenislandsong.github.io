abstract: "Ground reaction forces (GRFs) are essential for analyzing human movement and developing biomechanical models. However, measuring GRFs using force plates can be expensive and impractical outside of laboratory settings. This paper proposes a hybrid approach to estimate GRFs during gait using inertial measurement units (IMUs) and biomechanical models. The proposed method combines data from IMUs placed on the lower limbs with a musculoskeletal model to estimate joint kinematics and kinetics. These estimates are then used to compute GRFs using inverse dynamics. The method was validated using data collected from healthy participants walking at different speeds. Results showed that the proposed method can accurately estimate GRFs, with errors comparable to those obtained using force plates. This hybrid approach offers a cost-effective and practical alternative to force plates for measuring GRFs in various applications, such as gait analysis, rehabilitation, and sports performance."

## Summary
This paper presents a hybrid method for estimating ground reaction forces (GRFs) during gait by combining inertial measurement unit (IMU) data with a biomechanical model. IMUs placed on the lower limbs are used to estimate joint kinematics and kinetics, which are then used to compute GRFs via inverse dynamics. Validation against force plate data shows promising accuracy.

## Key Contributions and Insights
*   A novel hybrid approach is introduced that combines IMU data with a biomechanical model to estimate GRFs.
*   The method leverages inverse dynamics to compute GRFs from estimated joint kinematics and kinetics.
*   The study demonstrates that GRF estimation can be achieved with errors comparable to using force plates.
*   The proposed method offers a more practical and cost-effective alternative to force plates for gait analysis in real-world settings.
* The use of multiple IMUs and a biomechanical model potentially accounts for inter-subject variability compared to purely data-driven approaches.

## Why this is State-of-the-Art
This work offers a good balance between model-based and data-driven approaches. It moves beyond relying solely on machine learning models trained on large datasets, incorporating biomechanical principles for potentially better generalization. It allows for GRF estimation outside of a laboratory setting, and is cost effective compared to force plates. This hybrid approach represents an advance by incorporating kinematic models and reducing the need for extensive subject-specific training data often required by deep learning methods, while still leveraging sensor data.

## Weaknesses or Limitations and How to Improve
*   The reliance on a biomechanical model introduces potential inaccuracies if the model is not perfectly calibrated to the individual. Improve by using personalization through subject-specific model parameter estimation or adaptive model calibration techniques.
*   IMU placement and calibration errors can propagate through the inverse dynamics calculations. Robust sensor fusion techniques and error mitigation strategies could be employed.
*   The study is limited to level-ground walking. Further research is needed to evaluate the method's performance on more complex movements and terrains.
* The accuracy of the estimated GRFs might be affected by soft tissue artifacts. Techniques for reducing such effects could be incorporated.
