abstract: "Estimating ground reaction force (GRF) from inertial measurement units (IMUs) is crucial for various applications like biomechanics analysis and rehabilitation. However, achieving accurate GRF estimation across diverse individuals remains a challenge due to inter-subject variability in gait patterns. Existing methods often require substantial subject-specific training data, which can be burdensome to collect. To address this limitation, we propose a novel personalized GRF estimation framework based on few-shot learning. Our approach leverages a pre-trained GRF estimation model, which is trained on a large dataset of gait data to capture general gait patterns. We then personalize this model to individual subjects using only a small amount of subject-specific IMU and GRF data. Specifically, we employ a meta-learning strategy to learn how to adapt the pre-trained model effectively with limited data. We evaluate our approach on a publicly available dataset and demonstrate that it significantly outperforms traditional GRF estimation methods, especially when only a few trials are available for personalization. The results suggest that our few-shot learning framework offers a promising solution for accurate and personalized GRF estimation from IMUs, enabling wider adoption of IMU-based gait analysis in real-world applications."

**Summary:**

This paper introduces a new approach to estimating Ground Reaction Forces (GRF) from Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) that focuses on *personalization* using *few-shot learning*. The core idea is to leverage a pre-trained model (trained on a large general dataset) and then quickly adapt it to an individual's specific gait characteristics using only a small amount of data collected from that person.

**Key Contributions and Insights:**

*   **Few-Shot Learning for GRF Estimation:**  Addresses the problem of needing large amounts of subject-specific data for accurate GRF estimation. This is a common bottleneck in applying IMU-based GRF estimation in real-world scenarios.
*   **Pre-trained Model:**  Utilizes a pre-trained model to learn general gait patterns, allowing for efficient adaptation with limited subject-specific data.
*   **Meta-Learning Strategy:** Employs meta-learning to facilitate rapid and effective adaptation of the pre-trained model, demonstrating how to personalize the model most efficiently.
*   **Improved Accuracy with Limited Data:** Shows significant improvements in GRF estimation accuracy compared to traditional methods, especially when only a few trials are available for personalization.
*   **Practical Implications:**  This approach makes IMU-based GRF estimation more practical for applications where collecting extensive subject-specific data is not feasible (e.g., remote monitoring, in-home rehabilitation).

**Why this is state-of-the-art:**

*   **Personalization is Crucial:** Recognizing that gait is highly individual, this paper directly addresses the need for personalized GRF estimation.
*   **Few-Shot Learning is Powerful:**  Few-shot learning is a cutting-edge technique in machine learning, particularly relevant when data is scarce or expensive to acquire. This paper effectively applies it to the GRF estimation problem.
*   **Reduces Data Burden:** The focus on minimizing the amount of subject-specific data needed is a key step towards making IMU-based GRF estimation more accessible and scalable.

This paper represents a significant advancement in GRF estimation by making it more personalized and practical, paving the way for wider adoption of IMU-based gait analysis in various fields.
