abstract: "Estimation of ground reaction force (GRF) during walking is crucial for various biomechanical and clinical applications. While lab-based force plates are considered the gold standard for GRF measurement, their usage is limited to controlled environments. Inertial measurement units (IMUs) offer a promising alternative for GRF estimation in real-world settings. However, subject-specific gait characteristics and sensor placement variations pose significant challenges to achieving high accuracy and generalization. This study proposes a personalized GRF estimation approach that leverages a transformer-based deep learning model and a single IMU placed at the shank. The transformer architecture enables the model to capture long-range dependencies in the inertial data and effectively learn the complex relationship between IMU signals and GRFs. A personalized training strategy is employed, where the model is first pre-trained on a large dataset of GRF and IMU data from multiple subjects, and then fine-tuned on a small amount of subject-specific data. The proposed approach was evaluated on a dataset of 10 subjects walking at different speeds. The results demonstrate that the personalized transformer-based model significantly outperforms existing GRF estimation methods, achieving root mean squared errors of 0.08 BW, 0.05 BW, and 0.08 BW for the vertical, anterior-posterior, and mediolateral GRF components, respectively. Furthermore, an ablation study confirms the effectiveness of both the transformer architecture and the personalized training strategy. The findings suggest that the proposed approach holds great potential for enabling accurate and personalized GRF estimation in real-world gait analysis applications."

## Summary

This paper introduces a novel method for estimating ground reaction forces (GRFs) during level-ground walking using a single inertial measurement unit (IMU) placed on the shank and a transformer-based deep learning model. The key idea is to leverage the transformer architecture's ability to capture long-range dependencies within IMU data and combine it with a personalized training strategy. This involves pre-training the model on a large dataset of multiple subjects and then fine-tuning it using a small amount of subject-specific data.

The strengths of this paper lie in its use of a transformer architecture for GRF estimation, which is a relatively new approach in this domain. The personalized training strategy is also a strong point, as it addresses the issue of subject-specific gait variations that often limit the accuracy of generic GRF estimation models. The reported results demonstrate a significant improvement in accuracy compared to existing methods. The ablation study further supports the effectiveness of the transformer architecture and the personalized training.

However, there are also potential weaknesses. The study is limited to level-ground walking, and the performance of the model on more complex terrains or activities is not evaluated. The reliance on a single IMU is a strength in terms of simplicity, but it may also limit the amount of information available to the model, potentially impacting accuracy in certain scenarios. The need for subject-specific data for fine-tuning could be a barrier to adoption in situations where such data is not readily available. Finally, while the paper compares with existing methods, it would be beneficial to see comparisons with other state-of-the-art deep learning architectures (e.g., LSTMs or CNNs) specifically tailored for time-series data to better understand the specific benefits of the transformer architecture in this application.
