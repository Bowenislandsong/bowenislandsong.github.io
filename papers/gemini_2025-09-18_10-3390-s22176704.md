abstract: "Ground reaction force (GRF) is an important parameter for evaluating human movement ability and balance function. Accurate and convenient GRF estimation methods are essential for many applications. This paper presents a novel method for estimating GRF based on multi-sensor information fusion and deep learning. The proposed method fuses data from inertial measurement units (IMUs) and plantar pressure sensors (PPS) and uses a deep learning model based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network to estimate GRF. The CNN is used to extract local features from the multi-sensor data, and the LSTM network is used to capture the temporal dependencies in the data. The proposed method was evaluated on a dataset of gait data collected from 10 healthy subjects. The results show that the proposed method can accurately estimate GRF with root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 0.07 BW (body weight), 0.06 BW, and 0.05 BW for the vertical, mediolateral, and anteroposterior GRF components, respectively. The results also show that the proposed method outperforms existing GRF estimation methods based on IMUs or PPS alone. The proposed method has the potential to be used in a variety of applications, such as gait analysis, rehabilitation, and sports training."

## Summary
This paper proposes a ground reaction force (GRF) estimation method leveraging a fusion of data from inertial measurement units (IMUs) and plantar pressure sensors (PPS), processed through a hybrid convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) deep learning model. The CNN extracts local features from the sensor data, while the LSTM captures temporal dependencies. The method's performance was evaluated on gait data from healthy subjects, demonstrating accurate GRF estimation.

## Key Contributions and Insights
*   Fusion of IMU and plantar pressure sensor data for improved GRF estimation.
*   A hybrid CNN-LSTM deep learning model architecture tailored for processing multi-sensor gait data.
*   Demonstrated improved accuracy compared to methods relying on IMUs or PPS alone.
*   Quantitative evaluation on a dataset of healthy subjects showing low RMSE values for GRF estimation.
*   Highlights the potential of the method for applications in gait analysis, rehabilitation, and sports training.

## Why this is State-of-the-Art
This work integrates multiple sensing modalities (IMUs and PPS) with a sophisticated deep learning architecture (CNN-LSTM) to achieve enhanced GRF estimation accuracy. Combining these elements allows for a more comprehensive representation of the biomechanical system, thus potentially exceeding the performance of methods relying on a single type of sensor or simpler models. The use of a hybrid CNN-LSTM network is state-of-the-art because it leverages the strengths of both CNNs (feature extraction) and LSTMs (temporal modeling).

## Weaknesses or Limitations and How to Improve
*   The study is limited to healthy subjects. The performance on individuals with gait abnormalities or pathological conditions is unknown and should be investigated. Testing on diverse populations is needed.
*   The generalizability to different walking speeds or inclines might be limited. Further experiments across various gait conditions are necessary.
*   The placement and number of sensors are fixed, and the effect of varying sensor configurations wasn't investigated. Explore optimal sensor placement and robustness to variations in sensor locations.
*   The method relies on plantar pressure sensors, which may not be practical or comfortable for long-term monitoring or certain applications. Consider exploring other types of sensors, such as force-sensitive resistors integrated into clothing or shoes or other modalities like EMG.
*   Computational cost of CNN-LSTM models can be high, potentially limiting real-time applications. Investigate model compression techniques or efficient implementations for real-time performance.
