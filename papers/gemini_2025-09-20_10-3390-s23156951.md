abstract: 'Accurate estimation of ground reaction forces (GRFs) during running is important for several applications, including biomechanical analysis and sports performance assessment. Inertial measurement units (IMUs) have emerged as a practical tool for GRF estimation due to their low cost and portability. In this study, we propose a transformer-based neural network model for estimating GRFs during running using data from a single IMU placed on the shank. The model was trained and tested on a dataset collected from 10 participants running at different speeds. The results demonstrate that the proposed model can accurately estimate GRFs, with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.19 BW and a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.95 for the vertical GRF component. These findings suggest that the transformer-based approach is a promising technique for GRF estimation using IMUs, offering a potential alternative to traditional force plate measurements.'

## Summary
This paper introduces a transformer-based neural network model for estimating ground reaction forces (GRFs) during running using data from a single inertial measurement unit (IMU) placed on the shank. The model is trained and tested on data from multiple participants running at varying speeds, demonstrating accurate GRF estimation compared to force plate measurements. The approach offers a portable and cost-effective alternative to traditional GRF measurement methods.

## Key Contributions and Insights
*   Demonstrates the feasibility of using a transformer-based deep learning model for GRF estimation during running with a single shank-mounted IMU.
*   Achieves high accuracy in GRF estimation, comparable to other IMU-based methods, using a transformer architecture.
*   Provides a framework for GRF estimation that can be implemented with minimal equipment and setup.
*   Showcases the potential of transformers for capturing temporal dependencies in biomechanical signals.
*   Evaluates the model's performance on a dataset comprising multiple participants running at different speeds.

## Why this is State-of-the-Art
The use of a transformer architecture for GRF estimation from IMU data is a relatively recent advancement. Transformers excel at capturing long-range dependencies in sequential data, which is advantageous for modeling the complex dynamics of human movement. The single IMU placement simplifies the data collection process compared to multi-sensor systems. The reported accuracy levels are competitive with existing state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the potential of this approach.

## Weaknesses or Limitations and How to Improve
*   The model was trained and tested on a relatively small dataset (10 participants), which may limit its generalizability to different populations or running styles. Increasing the dataset size and diversity would improve robustness.
*   The study only focused on running at different speeds on a treadmill. Evaluating the model's performance on overground running and different running surfaces would be valuable.
*   The placement of the IMU was fixed on the shank. Investigating the optimal IMU placement and the model's sensitivity to placement variations could further improve performance.
*   The model's performance on estimating GRFs during more complex movements, such as turning or jumping, was not evaluated. Extending the model to handle more diverse activities would broaden its applicability.
*   The paper does not investigate the computational cost and real-time feasibility of the transformer model. Analyzing the computational requirements and optimizing the model for real-time applications would be beneficial.
