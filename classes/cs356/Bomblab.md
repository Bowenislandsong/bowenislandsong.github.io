# Binary Bomb Lab: A Strategic Field Manual

Welcome\! This guide is designed to help you tackle the Binary Bomb Lab. The goal isn't to give you the answers, but to teach you the **methodology** for defusing each phase. Every bomb is slightly differentâ€”the strings, numbers, and functions will changeâ€”but the underlying concepts and strategies for solving them are the same.

This manual will walk you through the thought process for a typical 8-phase bomb, showing you what to look for and how to use your tools effectively.

**Your Essential Toolkit:**

  * `objdump`: For disassembling the binary and getting a static "map" of the code.
  * `gdb`: For running the program in a controlled way, setting breakpoints, and inspecting memory and registers live.

-----

First things first, let's get a readable version of the assembly code.

```bash
objdump -d bomb > bomb.asm
```

## ðŸš€ Crucial First Step: Taming ASLR

Modern operating systems use **Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)** as a security feature. It shuffles the memory addresses of a program every time it runs. This is a problem because the addresses in your static `bomb.asm` file won't match the addresses when you run the bomb in GDB.

The easiest way to handle this is to turn it off within GDB. You must run this command **every time** you start a new GDB session.

```gdb
# Start GDB
gdb bomb

# Immediately disable randomization
(gdb) set disable-randomization on
```

> **Note:** For some bombs (especially later phases), you might still need to calculate addresses dynamically. We'll cover that when we get there.

## How to Approach Each Phase

Here's how to think about and solve each type of challenge you'll encounter.

### ðŸ’£ Phase 1: The Simple String

  * **Objective:** Find a secret password string. This is usually the easiest phase, designed to get you comfortable with the tools.

  * **Assembly Clues:** Look for a call to the `<strings_not_equal>` function. Right before this call, you'll see a `lea` (Load Effective Address) instruction loading the secret string's address into the `%rsi` register, which is used for the second argument of a function.

    ```assembly
    0000000000001702 <phase1>:
      1702:	48 8d 35 ff 1a 00 00 	lea    0x1aff(%rip),%rsi        # This is the key! It loads the address of the secret string.
                                                                        # objdump calculates the final address for you: 3208
      1709:	e8 8f ff ff ff       	call   169d <strings_not_equal> # Compares your input with the secret string.
      170e:	85 c0                	test   %eax,%eax
      1710:	74 05                	je     1717 <phase1+0x15>      # If strings ARE equal, eax is 0. test is 0. Jump to success.
      1712:	b8 01 00 00 00       	mov    $0x1,%eax                # Explode! (simplified)
      1717:	c3                   	ret                             # Success!
    ```

  * **GDB Strategy:**

    1.  Find the address calculated by `objdump` in the comment (in this case, `3208`).
    2.  Use the `x/s` (e**x**amine as **s**tring) command in GDB to print the string at that address.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```gdb
    # The address from the assembly comment was 0x3208
    (gdb) x/s 0x3208
    ```

  * **The Logic:** The program loads a secret string from memory to compare against your input. Your job is to find where that string is stored and read it.

-----

### ðŸ’£ Phase 2: Reading Multiple Inputs

  * **Objective:** Provide the correct sequence of inputs, typically a number and a string.

  * **Assembly Clues:** Look for a call to `<__isoc99_sscanf@plt>`. This is a dead giveaway that the program is parsing multiple inputs. You need to find all the checks it performs.

    ```assembly
    00000000000017a2 <phase2>:
      17c0:	e8 eb f8 ff ff       	call   10b0 <__isoc99_sscanf@plt>
      17c5:	83 f8 02             	cmp    $0x2,%eax              # Check 1: Did sscanf successfully read 2 items?
      17c8:	75 2e                	jne    17f8 <phase2+0x56>     # If not, jump to explode.
      17ca:	81 bc 24 cc 00 00 00 	cmpl   $0x15d17,0xcc(%rsp)    # Check 2: Compare the first input number with 0x15d17.
      17d5:	74 07                	je     17de <phase2+0x3c>     # If they are equal, continue.
      ...
      17e1:	48 8d 35 c6 1b 00 00 	lea    0x1bc6(%rip),%rsi      # Check 3: Load the secret string's address (at 0x33ae).
      17e8:	e8 50 ff ff ff       	call   173d <strings_not_equal> # Compare the second input string.
    ```

  * **GDB Strategy:**

    1.  Convert the hexadecimal number (`0x15d17`) to decimal. You can do this in GDB: `p/d 0x15d17`.
    2.  Find the address for the secret string from the second `lea` instruction (`0x33ae`) and use `x/s` to read it.

  * **The Logic:** The bomb expects exactly two inputs. You must provide the correct number and the correct string in the correct order.

-----

### ðŸ’£ Phase 3: Simple Math Puzzle

  * **Objective:** Find two numbers that satisfy a set of mathematical conditions.

  * **Assembly Clues:** Again, the code reads two numbers with `sscanf`. The key is to translate the comparison (`cmp`) and jump (`jge`, `jne`) instructions into mathematical rules.

    ```assembly
    0000000000001805 <phase3>:
      1829:	8b 44 24 0c          	mov    0xc(%rsp),%eax       # Move num1 into eax
      182d:	8b 54 24 08          	mov    0x8(%rsp),%edx       # Move num2 into edx
      1831:	39 d0                	cmp    %edx,%eax            # Compare num1 and num2
      1833:	7d 1a                	jge    184f <phase3+0x4a> # Jumps to explode if num1 >= num2. Rule 1: num1 < num2
      1835:	01 d0                	add    %edx,%eax            # sum = num1 + num2
      1837:	3d a9 5b 00 00       	cmp    $0x5ba9,%eax         # Compare sum to 0x5ba9
      183c:	75 18                	jne    1856 <phase3+0x51> # Jumps to explode if sum != 0x5ba9. Rule 2: sum = 0x5ba9
    ```

  * **The Logic:** Translate the assembly into a system of simple equations:

    1.  `num1 < num2`
    2.  `num1 + num2 = 0x5ba9` (which is 23465 in decimal)
        Once you have the rules, you can solve for any valid pair. A good strategy is to pick a simple first number (like 1) and solve for the second.

-----

### ðŸ’£ Phase 4: The Loop

  * **Objective:** Find a single number `N` that produces a specific result after being processed by a loop.

  * **Assembly Clues:** You'll see a clear loop structure. Your goal is to figure out what the loop is calculating by tracing the registers.

    ```assembly
    0000000000001860 <phase4>:
      # sscanf reads one number, N, into memory at 0xc(%rsp)
      187f:	89 c2                	mov    %eax,%edx          # eax is 1 from sscanf. edx is our counter, starts at 1.
      1881:	b9 00 00 00 00       	mov    $0x0,%ecx          # ecx is our accumulator (sum), starts at 0.
      1886:	eb 0d                	jmp    1895 <phase4+0x35> # Jump to the loop condition check

    0000000000001890 <phase4+0x30>:  # <--- Loop starts here
      1890:	01 d1                	add    %edx,%ecx          # sum = sum + counter
      1892:	83 c2 01             	add    $0x1,%edx          # counter++

    0000000000001895 <phase4+0x35>:
      1895:	39 54 24 0c          	cmp    %edx,0xc(%rsp)     # Compare counter (edx) with N (at rsp+0xc)
      1899:	7d f5                	jge    1890 <phase4+0x30> # If N >= counter, jump back to loop start

      # After the loop finishes:
      189b:	81 f9 c8 de bc 00    	cmp    $0xbcdec8,%ecx     # Compare the final sum with the target value
    ```

  * **The Logic:** The loop calculates the sum of integers from 1 to `N`. You need to reverse the calculation. The formula for this sum is $Sum = \\frac{N \\times (N + 1)}{2}$. You know the target `Sum` (`0xbcdec8`), so you just need to solve the equation for `N`.

-----

### ðŸ’£ Phase 5: The Hidden Data Structure

  * **Objective:** Provide inputs that, when used in a helper function, produce a target result.

  * **Assembly Clues:** The main phase function will be short. The real work is in the helper function it calls, in this case `<compute_total>`.

    ```assembly
    0000000000001919 <phase5>:
      # reads num1 and num2
      1945:	e8 76 ff ff ff       	call   18c0 <compute_total>
      194a:	3d 33 d6 45 00       	cmp    $0x45d633,%eax        # Compare the result with the target value
    ```

    Now, let's look inside `<compute_total>`:

    ```assembly
    00000000000018c0 <compute_total>:
      # This function loops from 0 to 3.
      # It adds your inputs to elements from a hidden array.
      18e3:	4c 8d 05 86 1b 00 00 	lea    0x1b86(%rip),%r8       # This instruction reveals the array's address: 0x3470
      ...
      18ed:	45 03 14 88          	add    (%r8,%rcx,4),%r10d     # Adds an array element to num2
      ...
      190d:	45 03 0c 88          	add    (%r8,%rcx,4),%r9d      # Adds an array element to num1
    ```

  * **GDB Strategy:**

    1.  Analyze `<compute_total>` to find the `lea` instruction that points to the hidden array (`0x3470`).
    2.  Use GDB to inspect the contents of this array. `x/4d 0x3470` will e**x**amine the memory and print **4** values in **d**ecimal format.

  * **The Logic:** By tracing `<compute_total>`, you'll find the formula is effectively `Result = 2 * (num1 + num2) + (sum of hidden array)`. Once you find the array values in GDB, you have the full formula and can solve for `num1` and `num2`.

-----

### ðŸ’£ Phase 6: The Prime Directive

  * **Objective:** Find two numbers that satisfy several complex conditions.

  * **Assembly Clues:** This phase breaks down into three checks. Focus on the easiest ones first.

    1.  **Range Check:** These instructions check if the numbers are in the valid range.
        ```assembly
        19af:	41 8d 80 11 e1 ff ff 	lea    -0x1eef(%r8),%eax  # r8 is input. eax = input - 7919
        19b6:	3d 1a 12 00 00       	cmp    $0x121a,%eax     # eax vs 4634. (i.e., input - 7919 vs 4634)
        19bb:	0f 87 9f 00 00 00    	ja     1a60 <phase6+0xe0> # Explode if input > 12553
        # This logic ensures 7919 <= input <= 12553
        ```
    2.  **Primality Check:** There's a very complicated loop from `1a00` to `1a2a`. This is a trial division algorithm to check if the numbers are prime. Don't waste time decoding it fully; assume it's a prime check and move on.
    3.  **Sum Check:** This one is simple and near the end.
        ```assembly
        1a43:	45 01 c8             	add    %r9d,%r8d              # r8d = r8d + r9d (sum = num1 + num2)
        1a46:	41 81 f8 9c 4e 00 00 	cmp    $0x4e9c,%r8d           # Compare sum to the target 0x4e9c
        ```

  * **The Logic:** Use the easiest constraints to narrow your search.

    1.  Find the required sum (`num1 + num2 = 0x4e9c`).
    2.  Pick a **prime number** that fits the required range.
    3.  Calculate its partner to achieve the sum.
    4.  Check if the partner is also prime and in range. If so, you've found the solution.

-----

### ðŸ’£ Phase 7: The Stateful Challenge

  * **Objective:** Find inputs that place elements correctly within a data structure that has been built up by your previous solutions. This phase is **stateful**.

  * **Assembly Clues:** The phase calls a helper function `<hp>` twice and checks its return value.

    ```assembly
    0000000000001b36 <phase7>:
      1b68:	e8 53 ff ff ff       	call   1ac0 <hp>
      1b6d:	83 f8 0a             	cmp    $0xa,%eax                # Is the result 10?
      ...
      1b7d:	e8 3e ff ff ff       	call   1ac0 <hp>
      1b82:	83 f8 05             	cmp    $0x5,%eax                # Is the result 5?
    ```

    The `<hp>` function itself reveals the data structure. It takes a number, adds it to an array, and then "bubbles it up" by repeatedly comparing it to its parent nodeâ€”the classic behavior of a **min-heap insertion**.

    ```assembly
    0000000000001ac0 <hp>:
      1ad2:	48 8d 15 87 36 00 00 	lea    0x3687(%rip),%rdx        # The location of the heap array, <xs> at 0x5160
      1ad9:	89 3c 8a             	mov    %edi,(%rdx,%rcx,4)     # Insert new element
      ...
      1b24:	39 cf                	cmp    %ecx,%edi              # Compare element with its parent
      1b26:	7c d8                	jl     1b00 <hp+0x40>         # If smaller, jump to swap and continue bubbling up
    ```

  * **GDB Strategy:** Static analysis isn't enough.

    1.  Set a breakpoint at the start of `phase_7` (`b phase_7`).
    2.  Run the bomb with all your previous correct solutions.
    3.  When GDB breaks, the heap is already populated from previous phases. Find its address (`0x5160`) from the `lea` instruction in `<hp>`.
    4.  Inspect the heap's current state: `x/10d 0x5160`.

  * **The Logic:** You need to choose input numbers that, when inserted into the *current state* of the min-heap, will end up in the required final positions (index 10 and index 5).

-----

### ðŸ’£ Phase 8: The Jump Table

  * **Objective:** Find a single number that selects the one correct execution path out of 64 possibilities.

  * **Assembly Clues:** The key pattern is an indirect `jmp`. It uses your input as an index into a table of addresses.

    ```assembly
    0000000000001b95 <phase8>:
      1bbc:	83 e0 3f             	and    $0x3f,%eax               # Mask input to get a value 0-63. This is the index.
      1bbf:	48 8d 15 ba 18 00 00 	lea    0x18ba(%rip),%rdx        # Load base address of the jump table (at 0x3480)
      1bc6:	48 63 04 82          	movslq (%rdx,%rax,4),%rax      # Look up the offset from the table using the index
      1bca:	48 01 d0             	add    %rdx,%rax                # Calculate the final jump address
      1bcd:	ff e0                	jmp    *%rax                    # JUMP!
    ```

    Your goal is to find which index leads to the **success path**. By scanning the code, you can find the only non-exploding path:

    ```assembly
    1d91:	b8 00 00 00 00       	mov    $0x0,%eax              # Success! Returns 0.
    1d96:	eb 7c                	jmp    1e14 <phase8+0x27f>
    ```

  * **GDB Strategy:**

    1.  Break at `phase_8`.
    2.  Step until *after* the `lea` instruction at `1bbf` to find the jump table's real-time address in the `%rdx` register (`p $rdx`).
    3.  Dump the entire jump table's contents. Note that the table stores *offsets*, not full addresses. So you should print them as signed decimal integers: `x/64d <real_address_from_rdx>`.
    4.  Calculate the required offset: `success_address - table_base_address`. In this case, `0x1d91 - 0x3480`.
    5.  Find that offset value in the GDB dump. The **index** of that entry is your answer.

Congratulations\! By following these strategies, you've learned how to analyze assembly, use a debugger effectively, and think your way through complex reverse-engineering puzzles. Good luck defusing your bomb\! ðŸŽ‰
